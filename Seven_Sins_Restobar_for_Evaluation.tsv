"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in bar my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."	0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0

This was like the final blow!	0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1

My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
Service sucks.	0
The shrimp tender and moist.	1

The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a bar.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked."	1

The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
This place has it!	1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
Omelets are to die for!	1
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience."	0

The waitresses are very friendly.	1
"Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!"	1
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."	0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
"The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness."	1
"Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."	1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0

I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
It was probably dirt.	0

"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!"	0
The service was a bit lacking.	0
"Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."	0

-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks."	1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
Owner's are really great people.!	1
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0

Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1

"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser."	1
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
