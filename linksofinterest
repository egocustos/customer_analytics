Boosted Decision Trees basic explanation:

Why doesn't Random Forest handle missing values in predictors?
Gradient Boosting Trees uses CART trees (in a standard setup, as it was proposed by its authors). 
CART trees are also used in Random Forests. What @user777 said is true, 
that RF trees handles missing values either by imputation with average, either by rough average/mode, 
either by an averaging/mode based on proximities. These methods were proposed by Breiman and Cutler and are used for RF. 
This is a reference from authors Missing values in training set.
However, one can build a GBM or RF with other type of decision trees. The usual replacement for CART is C4.5 proposed by Quinlan. 
In C4.5 the missing values are not replaced on data set. 
Instead, the impurity function computed takes into account the missing values by penalizing the impurity score with the ration of missing values.
On test set the evaluation in a node which has a test with missing value, 
the prediction is built for each child node and aggregated later (by weighting).
Now, in many implementations C4.5 is used instead of CART.
The main reason is to avoid expensive computation (CART has more rigorous statistical approaches, which require more computation), 
the results seems to be similar, the resulted trees are often smaller (since CART is binary and C4.5 not). 
I know that Weka uses this approach. I do not know other libraries, but I expect it to not be a singular situation. 
This would be an answer.
